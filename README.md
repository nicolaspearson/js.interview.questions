# Javascript Interview Questions

A collection of questions / tests to practice that will assist you in preparing for a javascript interview.

## Getting Started

1.  Install Jest Globally: `npm install jest -g`
2.  Run a test, e.g. `cd practice_exercises`, then run the test, e.g. `jest fib/test.js --watch`

## Directories

### Completed Exercises

Contains the completed exercises. Refer to these answers if you get stuck.

### Exercises

Contains the exercises. I suggest you duplicate this directory and provide a new name, e.g. `practice_exercises` when you want to start practising, this will allow to start over if you wish.

### Practice Exercises

Contains the exercises that you have completed. You can rename / delete this directory if you desire.
